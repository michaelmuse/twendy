#Twendy#
***
An engaging visualization of global Twitter trends.


###App Summary###
***

Twendy provides a user with a medium to explore the trending topics all over the world. A user can further explore how long current topics have been been trending and their historical popularity by heat index. The concept: while trends represent a moment in time, their is value in understanding their collective movement over time and by region.

The simple and (hopefully) intuitive user interface is built utilizing a combination of 3 d3 libraries, supported by AJAX calls with a Ruby on Rails backend & deployed to heroku.

Twendy was an educational and academic project produced by 5 te-wiffic General Assembly students with eight weeks of experience over the course of 4 days.
